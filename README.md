**1. Introduction**

**Overview**

The HR Management System is a multi-tenant **SaaS application** designed to centralize and streamline human resource operations for organizations. It provides a scalable and secure platform to handle various HR activities, including employee management, payroll processing, leave tracking, and performance reviews. Since the system serves multiple tenants (organizations), the architecture must ensure **data isolation**, **reliability**, and **seamless scaling** to handle growing demand.



**Purpose of the Documentation**

This documentation is intended for **developers**, **solution architects**, and **stakeholders**. It provides a detailed breakdown of the system’s architecture, including the rationale behind design decisions, security mechanisms, scalability strategies, and potential enhancements. The document aims to offer a solid understanding of how the system operates, why specific AWS components were chosen, and how they contribute to achieving the goals of the application.

---

**2. Architecture**

The architecture is designed around AWS services to ensure **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **elastic scalability**. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component in the system.


[![Overview](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/odhs5mdzzONuG9KDjQEL/preview?elements=HdLl1pH2XP-BaavxLNlbCQ&type=embed)](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/odhs5mdzzONuG9KDjQEL?elements=HdLl1pH2XP-BaavxLNlbCQ)


**2.1. Route 53 (DNS Service)**

**What is it?**

Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service. It provides domain name resolution, translating user-friendly domain names (e.g., www.hrm-system.com) into IP addresses required to route requests to the backend infrastructure.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Reliability**: Route 53 is designed for high availability and integrates seamlessly with AWS services.

 • **Routing Features**: It offers advanced routing options like latency-based, geolocation, and fail over routing to ensure optimal performance.

 • **Built-in Health Checks**: Route 53 can detect unhealthy endpoints and reroute traffic automatically.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **Google Cloud DNS**: Similar functionality but lacks the tight integration with AWS.

 • **Azure DNS**: Useful in Microsoft environments but less flexible in AWS deployments.

**Why Route 53?**

Route 53 was chosen due to its seamless AWS integration, allowing for easy DNS management and health-check capabilities to improve system resilience.

---

**2.2. API Gateway**

**What is it?**

AWS API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to create, publish, and monitor REST APIs. It acts as a front door for client applications to access back-end services.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Centralized API Management**: API Gateway handles API versioning, request throttling, and authentication.

 • **Secure Communication**: It integrates easily with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and other security services.

 • **Built-in Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle thousands of concurrent requests.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **Kong Gateway**: Open-source and highly flexible, but requires self-hosting and maintenance.

 • **NGINX**: Offers API gateway features but lacks the seamless AWS integration.

**Why API Gateway?**

API Gateway offers a fully managed solution with built-in support for **monitoring (CloudWatch)**, **security (AWS WAF)**, and **scaling**, reducing operational overhead.

---

**2.3. VPC and Subnets**

**What is it?**

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network in AWS. The architecture separates components into **public** and **private subnets** for better security and traffic management.

 • **Public Subnet**: Contains resources like API Gateway and the NAT Gateway that require internet access.

 • **Private Subnet**: Hosts sensitive resources like EC2 instances and databases, shielded from direct internet exposure.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Network Isolation**: Ensures that sensitive data remains inaccessible from the public internet.

 • **Traffic Control**: Security groups and network ACLs provide fine-grained control over inbound and outbound traffic.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **Shared VPC**: Useful in multi-account setups but lacks the granular control of a dedicated VPC.

 • **On-premises Network**: Would require significant infrastructure investment and lacks AWS’s scalability.

**Why VPC?**

A VPC ensures **secure, isolated networking** while leveraging AWS’s managed network services like NAT Gateway and VPC endpoints.

---

**2.4. EC2 Instances (Compute Layer)**

**What is it?**

Amazon EC2 provides virtual machines to run application back-ends and handle business logic.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Customizability**: EC2 offers full control over the operating system, network settings, and installed software.

 • **Scalability**: With Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), the system can dynamically adjust the number of instances based on traffic.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **AWS Lambda**: Ideal for serverless architectures but may lead to cold start latency for heavy, stateful workloads.

 • **Google Compute Engine**: Comparable service but lacks the tight integration with AWS tools.

**Why EC2?**

EC2 provides predictable performance for **back-end services** that require consistent compute power and low-latency network access.

---

**2.5. S3 (Storage Layer)**

**What is it?**

S3 is an object storage service used for **temporary** and **permanent file storage**.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Durability**: S3 provides 99.999999999% durability for stored objects.

 • **Cost Efficiency**: Data lifecycle policies can transition older files to Glacier for long-term storage at reduced costs.

 • **Access Control**: Supports fine-grained access via bucket policies and IAM roles.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **Azure Blob Storage**: Great for Microsoft environments but lacks S3’s mature ecosystem.

 • **Google Cloud Storage**: Strong contender but less flexible for AWS-native applications.

**Why S3?**

S3 is the industry standard for reliable, scalable, and secure object storage, making it the ideal choice for both temporary and permanent file storage.

---

**2.6. SQS (Notifications and Queuing)**

**What is it?**

Amazon SQS is a message queuing service used to decouple components and manage asynchronous processing of tasks.

**Why was it chosen?**

 • **Decoupling**: SQS allows backend services to process tasks independently, improving reliability and fault tolerance.

 • **Scalability**: SQS can scale to handle millions of messages per second.

**Alternatives Considered**

 • **Apache Kafka**: Offers higher throughput but is more complex to set up and manage.

 • **RabbitMQ**: Provides flexible routing options but requires self-hosting and maintenance.

**Why SQS?**

SQS provides a simple, managed, and scalable solution for handling inter-service communication.

**3. Security**

The architecture of the HR Management System prioritizes security at every level, aligning with best practices for securing a multi-tenant SaaS application. This section demonstrates how the existing provisions ensure compliance with **GDPR** and **ISO/IEC 27001** standards while addressing specific technical implementations evident in the provided application structure.

**3.1 Network Security**

**Purpose:**

Protect the infrastructure and resources from unauthorized access and attacks by implementing robust network isolation and traffic controls.

**Mechanisms Implemented:**

 1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**

 • All components, such as the **API Gateway**, EC2 instances, and S3 buckets, reside in a securely configured VPC.

 • Resources are distributed between **public** and **private subnets**:

 • **Public Subnet**: Hosts components like the API Gateway and NAT Gateway, which require external access.

 • **Private Subnet**: Hosts sensitive components like the EC2-based backend and RDS, ensuring they are not exposed to the internet.

 2. **Security Groups and Network ACLs:**

 • **Security Groups** act as firewalls at the instance level, ensuring that only specific traffic (e.g., HTTPS on port 443) can access the backend.

 • **Network ACLs** provide an additional layer of protection at the subnet level, blocking unauthorized traffic.

 3. **Application-Level Restrictions:**

In the provided **EmployeesPage** component, tabs, tables, and dropdown menus demonstrate how the frontend respects network security principles by only presenting data that the user’s role and permissions allow.

**Why this is important:**

 • Prevents unauthorized access to internal services and resources.

 • Protects against common network attacks like port scanning and unauthorized data extraction.

---

**3.2 Data Security**

**Purpose:**

Ensure tenant data is stored securely, protected against breaches, and available for authorized access only.

**Mechanisms Implemented:**

 1. **Encryption at Rest:**

 • **S3 buckets** are configured with **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**, leveraging **AWS KMS** for key management.

 • **RDS** stores data in an encrypted format to prevent unauthorized access even if the storage medium is compromised.

 2. **Encryption in Transit:**

 • All communication between users and the system, as well as between system components (e.g., **EmployeesPage** fetching data from APIs), is secured using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.

 3. **Access Control for S3 Data:**

 • Fine-grained bucket policies ensure that only authorized services and IAM roles can access S3 objects.

 • Example: Temporary and permanent storage for candidates’ resumes (seen in the application’s dropdowns and tabs) is tightly secured.

 4. **Frontend Data Presentation:**

 • Data in the frontend is shown selectively. For instance, in **EmployeesPage**, only necessary data (e.g., candidate names, email addresses, job positions) is displayed, adhering to the **data minimization** principle under GDPR.

**Why this is important:**

 • Prevents data theft and unauthorized access to sensitive HR data.

 • Ensures compliance with GDPR’s requirements for encryption and access control.

---

**3.3 Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

**Purpose:**

Restrict access to critical resources based on user roles and permissions, ensuring that each user or system component only has the access it needs.

**Mechanisms Implemented:**

 1. **IAM Roles and Policies:**

 • Backend and frontend services operate under tightly scoped IAM roles.

 • For instance, the **EmployeesPage** uses a specific backend API that validates permissions before returning data.

 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

 • Enabled for all privileged accounts to reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

 3. **Tenant-Specific Access Control:**

 • Data in the **EmployeesPage** (e.g., tabs like FutureForce Recruitment and HR Manager) is segregated by tenant, ensuring one tenant cannot access another’s data.

**Why this is important:**

 • Prevents privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

 • Ensures proper segregation of data between tenants.

---

**3.5 Compliance with GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001**

**GDPR Compliance**

 • **Data Minimization:** Only essential data (e.g., candidate names, emails, job roles) is processed and displayed in the **EmployeesPage**.

 • **Data Encryption:** Both at rest (S3 and RDS) and in transit (TLS).

 • **Right to Access and Erasure:** Backend APIs are designed to allow retrieval and secure deletion of user data.

 • **Data Breach Notification:** CloudWatch and SNS are used to monitor and alert stakeholders of potential breaches.

**ISO/IEC 27001 Compliance**

 • **Risk Assessment and Management:** GuardDuty and Security Hub continuously monitor for vulnerabilities.

 • **Access Control:** Fine-grained IAM roles and policies ensure that data access is restricted to authorized users.

 • **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Automated RDS backups and S3 cross-region replication provide resilience.

 • **Incident Management:** Incident response workflows are in place, supported by detailed audit logs.
